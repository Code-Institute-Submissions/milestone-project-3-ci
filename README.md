# Just Desserts

Just Desserts is a web based application for sharing recipes for desserts.
Users can add their own recipes (and then edit or delete them) or read other users' recipes. 
 
## UX
 
Use this section to provide insight into your UX process, focusing on who this website is for, what it is that they want to achieve and how your project is the best way to help them achieve these things.

####As a user, I want to browse and search for dessert recipes.

####As a user, I would like to see potential allergens in the recipes.

####As a registered user, I would like to submit my own recipes for others to see

####As a registered user, I would like to be able to edit my recipes and delete if necessary

####As a user, I would like to be able to find equipment I might want to purchase related to the recipes


This section is also where you would share links to any wireframes, mockups, diagrams etc. that you created as part of the design process. These files should themselves either be included as a pdf file in the project itself (in an separate directory), or just hosted elsewhere online and can be in any format that is viewable inside the browser.

## Features

In this section, you should go over the different parts of your project, and describe each in a sentence or so.
 
### Existing Features
- Feature 1 - allows users X to achieve Y, by having them fill out Z
- ...

For some/all of your features, you may choose to reference the specific project files that implement them, although this is entirely optional.

In addition, you may also use this section to discuss plans for additional features to be implemented in the future:

### Features Left to Implement
- Initially, I attempted to set up a virtualenv as per suggestion of mentor however after discussing with a tutor via webchat, I discovered that a virtualenv is more difficult to set up on Gitpod 
so this was abandoned. 
- A rating system - up to 5 stars.
- I spent some time trying to implement a login function but it caused me delays and issues so decided to press on without it

## Technologies Used

In this section, you should mention all of the languages, frameworks, libraries, and any other tools that you have used to construct this project. For each, provide its name, a link to its official site and a short sentence of why it was used.

- [JQuery](https://jquery.com)
    - The project uses **JQuery** to simplify DOM manipulation.
- [Bootstrap]  (https://getbootstrap.com/)
    - The project uses **Bootstrap** for styling and layout.
- [Flask](https://flask.palletsprojects.com/en/1.1.x/)
    - The project uses **Flask* to...
- [MongoDB] https://www.mongodb.com/)
    - The project uses **MongoDB** for creating, reading, updating and deleting data from a database.
- [Heroku]  (https://Heroku.com/)
    - The project uses **Heroku** for deploying and hosting the app.
- [Python] (https://python.org)


## Testing

In this section, you need to convince the assessor that you have conducted enough testing to legitimately believe that the site works well. Essentially, in this part you will want to go over all of your user stories from the UX section and ensure that they all work as intended, with the project providing an easy and straightforward way for the users to achieve their goals.

Whenever it is feasible, prefer to automate your tests, and if you've done so, provide a brief explanation of your approach, link to the test file(s) and explain how to run them.

For any scenarios that have not been automated, test the user stories manually and provide as much detail as is relevant. A particularly useful form for describing your testing process is via scenarios, such as:

1. Contact form:
    1. Go to the "Contact Us" page
    2. Try to submit the empty form and verify that an error message about the required fields appears
    3. Try to submit the form with an invalid email address and verify that a relevant error message appears
    4. Try to submit the form with all inputs valid and verify that a success message appears.

In addition, you should mention in this section how your project looks and works on different browsers and screen sizes.

You should also mention in this section any interesting bugs or problems you discovered during your testing, even if you haven't addressed them yet.

If this section grows too long, you may want to split it off into a separate file and link to it from here.

## Deployment

This section should describe the process you went through to deploy the project to a hosting platform (e.g. GitHub Pages or Heroku).

In particular, you should provide all details of the differences between the deployed version and the development version, if any, including:
- Different values for environment variables (Heroku Config Vars)?
- Different configuration files?
- Separate git branch?

In addition, if it is not obvious, you should also describe how to run your code locally.
